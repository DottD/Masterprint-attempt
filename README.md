# Masterprint attempt

This is a set of scripts that try to replicate the results of _Bontrager, Philip, Julian Togelius, and Nasir Memon. "Deepmasterprint: generating fingerprints for presentation attacks." arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.07386 (2017)_. Actually, the results were not as expected, but someone could find some of the scripts useful as a starting point for more complex architectures.

## Installation

The required packages should be listed in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt), although it may be not updated.

## Tests

There are not tests, because these scripts were quickly developed and continuously modified for research purposes.

## Contributing

Any contribution will be very much appreciated. Feel free to contact me in case of any doubts about contributing.
